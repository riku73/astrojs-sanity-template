# Copy Examples: Good vs Bad

Reference examples for each landing page section. These calibrate quality expectations for `/write-content`.

## Banned Word List

Never use these words in any section. They are vague, overused, and signal generic marketing copy:

> streamline, optimize, innovative, cutting-edge, revolutionary, next-gen, state-of-the-art, robust, scalable, seamless, leverage, empower, synergy, holistic, paradigm, transform (as buzzword), disrupt, game-changing, world-class, best-in-class, turnkey, end-to-end, solution (as standalone noun)

**Replace with:** specific outcomes, concrete actions, or customer language from the content brief.

## Hero Headlines

### Bad (generic, no specificity)
- "The Future of Communication" -- says nothing specific, could be any company
- "Revolutionize Your Workflow" -- banned word, vague outcome
- "Welcome to Our Platform" -- zero value proposition
- "Next-Gen AI for Modern Teams" -- two banned words, no benefit

**Why these fail:** They could appear on any competitor's site. They don't name a specific outcome or address a real pain.

### Good (specific, customer-language)
- "Your intelligent *copilot* for every message" -- names category, uses metaphor, asterisk on emotional word
- "Cut your inbox time *in half* without missing what matters" -- specific outcome, addresses fear of missing things
- "The *calm* way to handle 200 emails a day" -- emotional benefit, specific number, relatable pain
- "Stop writing emails. *Start* having conversations." -- reframes the activity, creates tension

**What makes these work:**
- They name a specific outcome the customer wants
- They use words the customer would actually say
- They address a real pain (not a hypothetical improvement)
- The `*asterisk*` phrase is the emotional beat (1-3 words, not technical terms)

---

## Hero Descriptions

### Bad
"Our innovative platform leverages cutting-edge AI to streamline your communication workflow and empower teams to collaborate more effectively."

**Why this fails:** 3 banned words ("innovative", "leverages", "cutting-edge", "streamline", "empower"). Says nothing specific. No customer benefit. Reads like a press release.

### Good
"You spend 3 hours a day sorting through messages that don't need your attention. Aireply reads, prioritizes, and drafts responses -- so you focus on the conversations that actually matter."

**What makes this work:**
- Sentence 1: Names the pain with a specific number (PAS: Problem)
- Sentence 2: States what the product does AND the outcome (PAS: Solve)
- Uses customer language ("sorting through messages", "actually matter")
- The em-dash creates rhythm

---

## Benefits Titles

### Bad (features, not benefits)
- "Powerful AI Engine" -- describes technology, not what customer gets
- "Seamless Integration" -- banned word, vague
- "Advanced Analytics" -- feature name, not outcome
- "Multi-Channel Support" -- technical capability

### Good (outcomes the customer wants)
- "Save time effortlessly" -- direct outcome
- "Never miss what matters" -- addresses a fear
- "Reply in your own voice" -- specific capability framed as benefit
- "One view for everything" -- solves fragmentation pain

**The test:** Would a customer say "I want [this title]"? If yes, it's a benefit. If they'd say "so what?", it's a feature.

---

## Benefits Content

### Bad
"Our platform utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to process and categorize your incoming communications across multiple channels, ensuring optimal workflow efficiency."

**Why this fails:** Describes mechanism (how it works), not outcome (what changes for the customer). Banned words. No emotional connection.

### Good
"Focus on what truly matters. Aireply handles the heavy lifting -- summarizing, organizing, and prioritizing your messages so you can stay ahead without the extra effort."

**What makes this work:**
- Opens with the outcome ("Focus on what truly matters")
- Lists specific actions (summarizing, organizing, prioritizing)
- Ends with emotional payoff ("stay ahead without the extra effort")
- 2 sentences, conversational tone

---

## Feature Card Descriptions

### Bad
"Our AI-powered engine uses advanced natural language processing to analyze and categorize your incoming communications with 99.7% accuracy."

**Why this fails:** Describes the HOW (technical mechanism), not the WHAT (customer outcome). The accuracy number is unverifiable and suspicious.

### Good
"Get instant, accurate summaries of long emails and chaotic threads."

**What makes this work:**
- Says exactly what the customer gets ("instant, accurate summaries")
- Uses their language ("long emails", "chaotic threads")
- One sentence, scannable
- No technical jargon

---

## Stats

### Bad Values
- "100%" -- unbelievable, no product is perfect
- "Millions of users" -- vague, sounds inflated
- "10x ROI" -- sounds like marketing, not proof
- "1000+" -- lazy, imprecise

### Good Values
- "8\u00d7" with "Faster inbox triage across all channels" -- specific multiplier, specific action
- "3.5 hrs/day" with "Less time writing, more time doing real work" -- relatable unit, customer benefit
- "98%" with "Replies that sound naturally like you" -- high but not perfect (believable), addresses real concern

**Rules for stats:**
- Odd or specific numbers feel more credible than round ones (87% > 90%)
- Always qualify: "Up to 8\u00d7 faster" not "8\u00d7 faster (proven)"
- The description must answer: "What does this number mean for ME?"
- If no real stats exist, use aspirational but believable metrics

### Mission Statement

### Bad
"We are committed to delivering innovative solutions that empower businesses to achieve their full potential through technology."

**Why this fails:** 3 banned words, says nothing unique, could be any tech company.

### Good
"Our mission is to create technology that feels calm, intentional, and human. We blend thoughtful design with quiet intelligence, helping you stay focused on what truly matters."

**What makes this work:** Specific personality ("calm, intentional, human"), unique angle ("quiet intelligence"), echoes customer desire ("focused on what truly matters").

---

## Testimonials

### Bad
"Great product! Really helped my team. Highly recommend. 5 stars!"

**Why this fails:** Generic, no story, no specifics, could be about any product. Exclamation marks scream fake.

### Good
"Long threads that used to drain my time now become clear, simple summaries I can act on instantly. For the first time in years, my inbox actually feels manageable."

**What makes this work:**
- Specific before state ("Long threads that used to drain my time")
- Specific after state ("clear, simple summaries I can act on instantly")
- Emotional language ("for the first time in years")
- Believable voice (no exclamation marks, no superlatives)

**Testimonial structure:** Before (pain) -> Change (what happened) -> After (outcome + emotion)

---

## FAQ Answers

### Bad
"Yes, absolutely! Our platform is incredibly secure with the latest technology. You have nothing to worry about!"

**Why this fails:** Exclamation marks, superlative ("incredibly"), vague ("latest technology"), dismissive ("nothing to worry about"). Sounds defensive, not trustworthy.

### Good
"All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We never sell your data or use it to train models. Aireply is SOC 2 compliant and follows industry best practices for data protection."

**What makes this work:**
- Direct answer (no hedging, no "absolutely!")
- Specific proof points (encrypted, SOC 2, never sold)
- Professional tone (no exclamation marks)
- Addresses the underlying concern, not just the surface question

**FAQ answer structure:** Direct answer (sentence 1) -> Supporting detail/proof (sentences 2-3) -> Optional redirect to action (sentence 4)

---

## CTA Headlines

### Bad
- "Get Started Today!" -- generic, no value proposition
- "Ready to Transform Your Workflow?" -- banned word, yes/no question (invites "no")
- "Sign Up Now" -- command without benefit

### Good
- "Inbox zero, *reimagined*" -- echoes hero promise, adds twist with asterisk
- "Your best reply is *one click away*" -- specific benefit, low-effort framing
- "Join thousands who reply *smarter*" -- social proof + benefit in one line

**What makes these work:** They restate the core promise from the hero but with a fresh angle. The asterisk phrase adds emotional weight. They don't ask a question (which invites "no").

---

## CTA Button Labels

### Bad
- "Get Started" -- generic, doesn't say what they get
- "Sign Up" -- action without outcome
- "Learn More" -- delays, doesn't drive conversion
- "Submit" -- worst possible label, sounds bureaucratic

### Good
- "Get early access" -- exclusivity + action
- "Start my free trial" -- first-person, specific offer
- "See it in action" -- low-commitment, curiosity
- "Book a demo" -- specific action for B2B

**The formula:** Action verb + what they get (not what they give up)

---

## Navigation Labels

### Bad
- "Our Solutions" -- corporate jargon
- "Learn More About Us" -- too long for nav
- "Resources and Documentation" -- too long

### Good
- "Benefits" / "Features" / "How it works" / "FAQ" -- direct section names
- "Pricing" -- if applicable
- "Testimonials" or "Reviews" -- social proof section

**Rule:** 1-2 words per nav item. Match the actual section anchor.

---

## Footer Description

### Bad
"Leading provider of AI-powered communication solutions for enterprise teams worldwide."

**Why this fails:** Sounds like a LinkedIn tagline. "Leading provider" is an unearned claim. "Enterprise teams worldwide" is vague.

### Good
"A calm AI copilot that helps you find focus in your inbox."

**What makes this work:** One sentence. Uses the brand personality ("calm"). States the benefit ("find focus"). Matches the hero's promise.
